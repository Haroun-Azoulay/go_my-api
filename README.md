# <p align="center">My_Api - API REST GOlang with jwt token </p>


## Context
This project is a RESTful API built in Go (Golang) to demonstrate how to create a basic API for a library system. It is designed as a learning resource for students in an IT school (level: Bac +2).

The API provides essential functionalities like managing books, users, and authentication via JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It's a practical example to teach the fundamentals of API development, authentication, and interaction with a database using Go.

Students will explore:

- Structuring a Go project for API development.
- Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for resources (books and users).
- Securing API endpoints using JWT for role-based access (admin and user privileges).
 - Managing data persistence using a relational database (MariaDB).

The project can be extended to cover more advanced topics such as middleware, testing, and deployment.


## Subject

 Develop an API to manage a library system where users can:
    
  
- Users:
    Register and log in to the system.
    Access the list of available books.
    Update their user information (restricted actions based on roles).
-Books:
    Add new books (admin only).
    Update or delete books (admin only).
    View the list of books (open to all users).
    
    Students will learn how to implement the above features while following industry standards for API design and security.
